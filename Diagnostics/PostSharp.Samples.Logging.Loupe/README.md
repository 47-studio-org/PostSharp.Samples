# PostSharp.Samples.Logging.Loupe

This example demonstrates how to configure the PostSharp Logging aspect so that it prints its output to Loupe from Gibraltar.
The application automatically opens an empty window of the Loupe Viewer. You should then see a Loupe desktop notification saying that a new
session is available. Click on this notification to open the log, and ignore the empty window that first opened.
