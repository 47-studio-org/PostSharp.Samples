## Credits

This example is forked from https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/serilog-sinks-http-sample-elastic-stack. All credits for integrating Elastic Stack with Serilog goes to the original author.

The `elastic-stack` directory is a clone of [docker-elk](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk) with minor modifications done by FantasticFiasco. Credit to [deviantony](https://github.com/deviantony) for publishing the Elastic Stack boilerplate.

## Introduction

[Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/products) is fantastic at collecting and visualizing log events. [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) is fantastic at producing structured log events.  [PostSharp Diagnostics](https://www.postsharp.net/diagnostics) 
is fantastic at instrumenting your project and feeding Serilog with plently structured log events.

This repository provides a sandbox where developers can explore the life of a log event starting with its birth in PostSharp and Serilog, its transport over the network to Logstash, its fields being indexed by Elasticsearch and finally its legacy being recorded as a historical event in Kibana.
This example contains two applications that run together, so we can explore the correlation of requests coming from both apps.

## What you will end up with

![alt text](./doc/resources/kibana.png "Kibana rendering log events")

TODO: Update sceenshot.

With a running Elastic Stack and Serilog producing log events you are now ready to take it to the next level. If you fancy the producing part you'll dig deeper into Serilog and its configuration of log contexts, enrichers and message formatters. If you enjoy monitoring applications in production you'll explore Kibana with its visualizations and dashboards.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

## Usage on Windows

### Bringing up Elastic Stack

Start the stack using `docker-compose`:

```posh
PS> cd .\elastic-stack\
PS> docker-compose up
```

If this is the first time the stack is started, you'll have to create a Logstash index pattern. Give the stack some time to initialize and then run the following commands in PowerShell:

```posh
PS> $Headers = New-Object "System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary[[String],[String]]"
PS> $Headers.Add("Content-Type", "application/json")
PS> $Headers.Add("kbn-version", "6.2.3")
PS> Invoke-RestMethod "http://localhost:5601/api/saved_objects/index-pattern" `
      -Method Post `
      -Headers $Headers `
      -Body '{"attributes":{"title":"logstash-*","timeFieldName":"@timestamp"}}'
```

### Publishing log events using PostSharp and Serilog

This runs the web service:

```posh
PS> cd .\MicroserviceSample\
PS> dotnet run
```

And this runs the console app:

```posh
PS> cd .\ClientSample\
PS> dotnet run
```

### Using Kibana to render the log events

Access the Kibana web UI by hitting [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) with a web browser.

## Usage on Linux

### Bringing up Elastic Stack

Start the stack using `docker-compose`:

```bash
$ cd elastic-stack/
$ docker-compose up
```

If this is the first time the stack is started, you'll have to create a Logstash index pattern. Give the stack some time to initialize and then run the following commands:

```bash
$ curl -XPOST -D- 'http://localhost:5601/api/saved_objects/index-pattern' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'kbn-version: 6.2.3' \
    -d '{"attributes":{"title":"logstash-*","timeFieldName":"@timestamp"}}'
```

### Publishing log events using Serilog

```bash
$ cd MicroserviceSample/
$ dotnet run
```

And this runs the console app:

```bash
$ cd ClientSample/
$ dotnet run
```

### Using Kibana to render the log events

Access the Kibana web UI by hitting [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) with a web browser.
